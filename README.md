This Java program simulates a simple library system using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It defines a base class Item for general library items, with subclasses Book and Magazine that add specific attributes. The Book class implements the IBorrowable interface to manage borrowing functionality, with methods for borrowing, returning, and checking if an item is borrowed. The program uses the Singleton pattern in the Library class to manage a collection of items and ensure only one instance exists. A Factory pattern is implemented in the LibraryItemFactory class to create Book or Magazine objects based on input. The LibraryTest class demonstrates borrowing, returning, and listing available items, showcasing the libraryâ€™s management and search functionality.
